   Parallel (Risch-Norman) integration over a simple radical y^2 = q sitting
   anywhere in a tower of transcendental generators, after

     S. Blake, Parallel Integration over Simple Radical Extensions II: Mixed Towers.

   Elements of L = K(y) are pairs {a, b} = a + b y for y^2 = q, and for a
   radical y^m = q of degree m >= 3 the m-tuples of coordinates on the Trager
   basis w_i = y^i/E_i (Part I, Prop. 3.2).  The tower is
     Tower[gens, derivs, q, m]   with derivs[[i]] = D(gens[[i]]) as a tuple,
   q = None for m = 1 (no radical).

   Stage 1 covers: pair arithmetic, the derivation, valuations and the
   classification (normal/special, delta_P), Hermite denominators, exact-order
   residues on every sheet with the exact constancy certificate, the quadratic
   y-split, tower specials, the ansatz and the linear system, and verification.
   Stage 2 adds the norm search, vanishing orders, deep residues (n = 1),
   elliptic torsion (division polynomials, Miller functions) and the v_oo
   residue; stage 3 the units (continued fractions over Q and GF(p)), the
   non-torsion certificates (Proposition 9.4: for the class at infinity by
   the continued fraction over GF(p), for a residue divisor at finite
   places by Cantor's algorithm in the Jacobian over GF(p), any genus), and
   the holomorphic-remainder certificate, with
   the special exponents and degree bounds of Algorithm 6 (Section 8.2:
   proved where Proposition 8.11 applies, the classical guess elsewhere).  Radicals of degree m >= 3 (y^m = q,
   q m-th-power-free) are handled on the Trager basis w_i = y^i/E_i:
   residue classes with the m x m norm, realisation by Hensel lifting and
   linear algebra with the poles distributed over the places at infinity,
   unit candidates from a bounded divisor search at infinity (UnitsGeneral).
   Not covered for m >= 3: S'-units over special primes, residue classes on
   several but not all sheets over one root, partially ramified branch
   primes, and the non-torsion certificate.  The port is complete.

   2026-09-27 (with the review corpus review_corpus.py / review_wl.py): the
   holomorphic-remainder certificate in the second-kind variant (b') for any
   m, with exact valuations and residues at the places over infinity
   (InfExpansion, VInf, ResInfAll, SecondKindAtInfinityQ); (K4) at x = oo of
   the base; the residues at critical poles over branch primes for m = 2
   (Trager's rule on the transcendental copy of the tower); the completion
   condition at infinity of the mod-p certificate (InfDivisorData); no
   certificate over a coefficient field with transcendental constants
   (TransConsts); conic radicands with algebraic pole primes parametrised
   first, over a quadratic field when there is no rational point
   (AlgebraicPoint); the held exponential PMExp (x^Sqrt[2], x^a, 2^x) and
   ProductLog as generator heads; honest {"failed", ...} statuses from the
   surface entry point (tower construction, a vanishing denominator).  The
   logarithmic part over a prime of a transcendental tower whose places or
   residues are Root objects is one RootSum (the Rothstein--Trager /
   Lazard--Rioboo--Trager form; RootSumLogand, GroupRootLogs), and the
   residual is reduced by the rational function the kernel evaluates over K:
   the term-by-term arithmetic over the splitting field of a quartic prime
   was intractable (R291, R323, the parametrised conics of the corpus).

   The function names are the Python names in CamelCase; the verbose trace
   lines are the same, so sessions can be compared between the two.          *)

Tower::usage = "Tower[gens, derivs, q, m] builds the differential tower L = F(gens)(y), y^m = q (m = 2 by default), over which ParallelIntegrateMixed works. For m >= 3 the elements are m-tuples of coordinates on the Trager basis w_i = y^i/E_i, q must be m-th-power-free, and the Association also carries \"m\", \"n\" (the tuple length), \"E\", the multiplication table \"mul\", the logarithmic derivatives \"Lam\" (D w_i = Lam_i w_i) and \"Dw\" = {D w_0, ..., D w_{m-1}}.
  gens   -- list of generator symbols {t1, ..., tn}; t1 = x is the base variable and must satisfy D(x) = 1.
  derivs -- list of pairs {a, b}, one per generator, giving D(ti) = a + b y with a, b rational functions of the generators. The pair for x is {1, 0}. Generators above the radical may have b != 0 (their derivatives involve y): this is the 'mixed' setting.
  q      -- the radicand, a squarefree polynomial in the generators (usually in x alone); omit it, or pass None, for m = 1 (a purely transcendental tower, e.g. after a pure root has been flattened into the basis).
The result is an Association with keys \"gens\", \"derivs\", \"q\" and, when q is present, \"Dy\" = D(y) as a pair, computed from Dq = Q0 + Q1 y as Dy = Dq/(2y) = Q1/2 + (Q0/(2q)) y.";

  special -- True if P is special (v_P(D pi) > -eta for the uniformiser pi = p, or pi = y at a branch prime), False if P is normal. Special primes are carried as candidate logands and may appear in the denominator of the integral with a guessed exponent; normal primes obey the valuation lemma and carry residues.";

The decision reduces tau to the canonical form (a + b Sqrt[A]) / D0 with a, b, D0 rational in the generators; tau is constant iff b = 0 and a/D0 is free of the generators. A constant-in-disguise must never be mistaken for an obstruction, so a syntactic free-variable test is not used.";

ParallelIntegrateMixed::usage = "ParallelIntegrateMixed[integrand, x, opts] integrates an expression in x built from rational operations, one square root of a polynomial (the radical y^2 = q), pure roots that flatten (Lemma 3.2: a root whose base is linear in a generator with a constant coefficient, such as Sqrt[x], Sqrt[x + Log[x]], (x + Exp[x])^(1/3), Sqrt[Log[x]]), and logarithms, exponentials, general powers (x^Sqrt[2], x^a, 2^x as exponentials), tangents, inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and ProductLog of expressions in the field generated so far; free symbols other than x are transcendental parameters, over which no non-elementarity certificate is issued. The tower is constructed automatically (BuildTower), the integral computed by the pair form below, and the result returned in terms of x; a tower that cannot be built gives {\"failed\", \"tower construction failed\", integrand}, and an integrand whose denominator vanishes identically once dependent generators are identified {\"failed\", \"integrand undefined: ...\", den}. Option \"Verify\" -> True additionally checks D[result, x] against the integrand numerically at three points.

Options: \"SplitSpecials\" -> Automatic (default) retries a failed system with every special prime split into its linear factors over the algebraic closure, each with its own coefficient (needed e.g. for Sqrt[Tan[x]]); True always splits, False never; \"Bounds\" -> {b1, ..., bn} fixes the degree bounds of the numerator of the rational part in each generator (default: Algorithm 6 of the paper -- proved by Proposition 8.11 where it applies, else the maximal degree occurring + 2, raised on retry); \"Verbose\" -> True prints the classification of every prime, the residues on every sheet, the candidate logands and the special primes, in the same format as the SymPy implementation so sessions can be compared.
Steps (Algorithm 4): factor the denominator of f; for each prime, ClassifyPrime; specials become candidate logands and denominator factors; normal primes with a pole deeper than delta contribute Hermite factors to the denominator; normal primes with a pole of order exactly delta carry residues, computed on every sheet, certified constant or not, and realised as logands (equal residues -> the polynomial p; residues split by the curve -> the quadratic y-split; at a prime of degree > 4 the residues are computed in the residue field K[g]/(p) -- the residue polynomial of Rothstein and Trager -- and each residue class is realised from its sheet polynomial by Hensel lifting and linear algebra over K(c)); then the tower specials are added, the residual f - Sum c_i D u_i / u_i is formed, and the linear system for the rational part and the unknown logand coefficients is solved.";

   step of Rothstein and Trager inside Algorithm 2).  tp = {tau0, tau1} is
   the residue expression e (f h / Dh) as a pair; its classes modulo p are the
   residues tau0(alpha) +- tau1(alpha) y0 on the two sheets over each root

   places with residue c lie over p_c = gcd(p, tau1^2 q - (c - tau0)^2) on
