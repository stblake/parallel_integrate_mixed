   Parallel (Risch-Norman) integration over a simple radical y^2 = q sitting
   anywhere in a tower of transcendental generators, after

     S. Blake, Parallel Integration over Simple Radical Extensions II: Mixed Towers.

   Elements of L = K(y) are pairs {a, b} = a + b y for y^2 = q, and for a
   radical y^m = q of degree m >= 3 the m-tuples of coordinates on the Trager
   basis w_i = y^i/E_i (Part I, Prop. 3.2).  The tower is
     Tower[gens, derivs, q, m]   with derivs[[i]] = D(gens[[i]]) as a tuple,
   q = None for m = 1 (no radical).

   Stage 1 covers: pair arithmetic, the derivation, valuations and the
   classification (normal/special, delta_P), Hermite denominators, exact-order
   residues on every sheet with the exact constancy certificate, the quadratic
   y-split, tower specials, the ansatz and the linear system, and verification.
   Stage 2 adds the norm search, vanishing orders, deep residues (n = 1),
   elliptic torsion (division polynomials, Miller functions) and the v_oo
   residue; stage 3 the units (continued fractions over Q and GF(p)), the
   non-torsion certificate, and the holomorphic-remainder certificate with
   the exact bounds of Part I.  Radicals of degree m >= 3 (y^m = q,
   q m-th-power-free) are handled on the Trager basis w_i = y^i/E_i:
   residue classes with the m x m norm, realisation by Hensel lifting and
   linear algebra with the poles distributed over the places at infinity,
   unit candidates from a bounded divisor search at infinity (UnitsGeneral).
   Not covered for m >= 3: S'-units over special primes, residue classes on
   several but not all sheets over one root, partially ramified branch
   primes, and the two m = 2 certificates (non-torsion, holomorphic
   remainder).  The port is complete.

   The function names are the Python names in CamelCase; the verbose trace
   lines are the same, so sessions can be compared between the two.          *)

Tower::usage = "Tower[gens, derivs, q, m] builds the differential tower L = F(gens)(y), y^m = q (m = 2 by default), over which ParallelIntegrateMixed works. For m >= 3 the elements are m-tuples of coordinates on the Trager basis w_i = y^i/E_i, q must be m-th-power-free, and the Association also carries \"m\", \"n\" (the tuple length), \"E\", the multiplication table \"mul\", the logarithmic derivatives \"Lam\" (D w_i = Lam_i w_i) and \"Dw\" = {D w_0, ..., D w_{m-1}}.
  gens   -- list of generator symbols {t1, ..., tn}; t1 = x is the base variable and must satisfy D(x) = 1.
  derivs -- list of pairs {a, b}, one per generator, giving D(ti) = a + b y with a, b rational functions of the generators. The pair for x is {1, 0}. Generators above the radical may have b != 0 (their derivatives involve y): this is the 'mixed' setting.
  q      -- the radicand, a squarefree polynomial in the generators (usually in x alone); omit it, or pass None, for m = 1 (a purely transcendental tower, e.g. after a pure root has been flattened into the basis).
The result is an Association with keys \"gens\", \"derivs\", \"q\" and, when q is present, \"Dy\" = D(y) as a pair, computed from Dq = Q0 + Q1 y as Dy = Dq/(2y) = Q1/2 + (Q0/(2q)) y.";

TowerD::usage = "TowerD[T, u] is the derivation of the tower T applied to the pair u = {a, b} = a + b y, returned as a pair. It is the sum of D applied coefficientwise to a and b (through every generator, using the chain rule with T[\"derivs\"]) and of b D(y), with y^2 = q used to keep the result on the basis {1, y}.";

ClassifyPrime::usage = "ClassifyPrime[T, p] classifies the height-one primes of the working ring lying over the irreducible polynomial p (Definition 4.3 of the paper) and returns {branch, eta, delta, special}:
  branch  -- True if p divides the radicand q (the primes over p are ramified, e_P = 2);
  eta     -- the order of the denominator divisor of D at P: eta = max(0, -v_P(D t_i), -v_P(D y));
  delta   -- the pole order of the derivation, delta = 1 + eta, so that v_P(D g) = v_P(g) - delta for v_P(g) != 0 at a normal prime (the valuation lemma);
  special -- True if P is special (v_P(D pi) > -eta for the uniformiser pi = p, or pi = y at a branch prime), False if P is normal. Special primes are carried as candidate logands and may appear in the denominator of the integral with a guessed exponent; normal primes obey the valuation lemma and carry residues.";

  Undecided -- the expression contains more than one algebraic function, or a non-square-root algebraic function, and no verdict is issued.
The decision reduces tau to the canonical form (a + b Sqrt[A]) / D0 with a, b, D0 rational in the generators; tau is constant iff b = 0 and a/D0 is free of the generators. A constant-in-disguise must never be mistaken for an obstruction, so a syntactic free-variable test is not used.";

ParallelIntegrateMixed::usage = "ParallelIntegrateMixed[integrand, x, opts] integrates an expression in x built from rational operations, one square root of a polynomial (the radical y^2 = q), pure roots that flatten (Lemma 3.2: a root whose base is linear in a generator with a constant coefficient, such as Sqrt[x], Sqrt[x + Log[x]], (x + Exp[x])^(1/3), Sqrt[Log[x]]), and logarithms, exponentials and tangents of expressions in the field generated so far. The tower is constructed automatically (BuildTower), the integral computed by the pair form below, and the result returned in terms of x.

Options: \"SplitSpecials\" -> Automatic (default) retries a failed system with every special prime split into its linear factors over the algebraic closure, each with its own coefficient (needed e.g. for Sqrt[Tan[x]]); True always splits, False never; \"Bounds\" -> {b1, ..., bn} fixes the degree bounds of the numerator of the rational part in each generator (default: maximal degree occurring + 2); \"Verbose\" -> True prints the classification of every prime, the residues on every sheet, the candidate logands and the special primes, in the same format as the SymPy implementation so sessions can be compared.
Steps (Algorithm 4): factor the denominator of f; for each prime, ClassifyPrime; specials become candidate logands and denominator factors; normal primes with a pole deeper than delta contribute Hermite factors to the denominator; normal primes with a pole of order exactly delta carry residues, computed on every sheet, certified constant or not, and realised as logands (equal residues -> the polynomial p; residues split by the curve -> the quadratic y-split; at a prime of degree > 4 the residues are computed in the residue field K[g]/(p) -- the residue polynomial of Rothstein and Trager -- and each residue class is realised from its sheet polynomial by Hensel lifting and linear algebra over K(c)); then the tower specials are added, the residual f - Sum c_i D u_i / u_i is formed, and the linear system for the rational part and the unknown logand coefficients is solved.";
